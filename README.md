# Hedonic-SQL-Data-Cleaning-Exercise
I clean, transform, and wrangle Nashville, TN housing data into a more usable format ready for analysis.

The dataset is hedonic in nature, describing various characteristics of the housing market of Nashville, TN. 

The initial dataset contains ~56,500 rows & ~19 columns. 

I cleaned, transformed, and wrangled the dataset to make the dataset into a more usable format ready for analysis. 

In doing so, I utilized the power of SQL. 

In SQL, I utilized a variety of different functions like ParseNames, AlterTables, Updates, 
OrderBys, Joins, Substrings, Sets, GroupBys, among many other functions. 

In this exercise, I demonstrate my profiency utilizing SQL. 

I also demonstrate my technical ability when it comes to "cleaning" large datasets.
